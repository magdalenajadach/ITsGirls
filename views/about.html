	<h2>Hello World!</h2>
	<h3>My name is Magdalena Jadach and I am a Software Developer</h3>
	<h4>The Girls In IT web application was written as a part of developer mentorship program for women <a href="https://www.learnitgirl.com/" target="_blank">'Learn IT, girl!'</a>. During the course of the program I was guided by my mentor, Emanuele Libralato (you can say 'hallo' to him <a href="http://www.tenko.it" target="_blank">here</a>.</h4>
	<h4>For last few years I used to be a journalist in Krakow, Poland. Some time ago I became in coding and software development and after few months of treating this as a hobby I decided to switch my career path to become a programmer. Its certainly worth to chase your dreames, because they became true and today I am working as a Front End Developer in London, UK.</h4>
	<h4>This application is a fusion of my two passions: code and news. I decided to build it to show IT stories from a different perspective - women in tech. I also hoped to encourage other girls and women to chase their own dreams and perhaps, get them interested in IT.</h4>
	<h4>IT's a great journey! </h4>
